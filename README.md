#Derma Vision Skin Lesion Analysis and Classification

Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells, often caused by damage from UV radiation. The most common types include:
Melanoma
Basal Cell Carcinoma
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Early detection is crucial, as skin cancer is highly treatable in its initial stages. However, manual diagnosis can be time-consuming and subjective.

Why Use Deep Learning?
Traditional image processing techniques may struggle with complex patterns in skin lesions. Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can automatically learn visual patterns such as:
Lesion texture
Color variation
Asymmetry
Border irregularity
These are key features used by dermatologists for diagnosis — and CNNs are excellent at identifying them from raw image data.

How CNN Works in This Project
Convolutional Layers: Extract features like edges, spots, and color gradients.
Pooling Layers: Downsample feature maps, retaining the most important features.
Flattening: Convert 2D data to 1D for the dense layers.
Fully Connected Layers: Interpret the features and classify the skin lesion.
Output Layer: Uses Softmax to predict the class of skin disease.
